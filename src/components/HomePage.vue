                  Novusphere provides an immutable liability-free blockchain based database which developers can use to build censorship resistant platforms. 
                  We believe that freedom of speech and expression as well as other rights are gradually being eroded and seek to address these issues. 
                  <br>
                  <strong>Any traditional application which relies on a centralized database can use Novusphere as an alternative.</strong>
